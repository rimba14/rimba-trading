/**
 * Highlight all visible occurrences of `query` in the screen buffer by
 * inverting cell styles (SGR 7). Post-render, same damage-tracking machinery
 * as applySelectionOverlay — the diff picks up highlighted cells as ordinary
 * changes, LogUpdate stays a pure diff engine.
 *
 * Case-insensitive. Handles wide characters (CJK, emoji) by building a
 * col-of-char map per row — the Nth character isn't at col N when wide chars
 * are present (each occupies 2 cells: head + SpacerTail).
 *
 * This ONLY inverts — there is no "current match" logic here. The yellow
 * current-match overlay is handled separately by applyPositionedHighlight
 * (render-to-screen.ts), which writes on top using positions scanned from
 * the target message's DOM subtree.
 *
 * Returns true if any match was highlighted (damage gate — caller forces
 * full-frame damage when true).
